diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.
type 2 diabetes is caused by the bodyâ€™s ineffective use of insulin, often due to obesity and physical inactivity.
gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth.
common symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow healing of wounds.
insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose by facilitating its uptake into cells.
normal fasting blood sugar levels are between 70 and 99 mg/dl.
prediabetes is defined by fasting blood sugar levels between 100 and 125 mg/dl.
a fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dl or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.
hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) reflects average blood glucose over the past 2 to 3 months; values of 6.5% or higher suggest diabetes.
type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children or young adults, but it can develop at any age.
type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, accounting for about 90-95% of cases.
maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and regular physical activity are key to managing and preventing type 2 diabetes.
people with diabetes are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.
high blood sugar levels over time can damage nerves, leading to a complication known as diabetic neuropathy.
diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness.
kidney failure is a serious complication of long-term poorly controlled diabetes.
foot ulcers in people with diabetes can lead to serious infections and may require amputation if untreated.
continuous glucose monitors (cgms) allow people with diabetes to track glucose levels in real time.
metformin is a common oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes by improving insulin sensitivity.
insulin injections are essential for treating type 1 diabetes and may also be used in advanced type 2 cases.
the glycemic index measures how a carbohydrate-containing food raises blood glucose levels.
low glycemic index foods include whole grains, legumes, non-starchy vegetables, and most fruits.
exercising regularly improves insulin sensitivity and helps lower blood glucose levels.
stress can affect blood sugar levels by increasing the release of hormones like cortisol.
a diabetes-friendly diet emphasizes whole grains, lean proteins, non-starchy vegetables, and minimal added sugars.
skipping meals can lead to hypoglycemia in people taking insulin or certain oral medications.
alcohol consumption can cause blood sugar fluctuations and should be done cautiously by people with diabetes.
smoking increases the risk of diabetes complications, including cardiovascular disease and poor circulation.
regular eye exams are recommended for people with diabetes to detect early signs of retinopathy.
uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of birth defects and preeclampsia.
children with type 1 diabetes require regular insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring.
in type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin.
rapid-acting insulin begins to work within 15 minutes and is used before meals.
basal (long-acting) insulin provides a steady insulin level throughout the day and night.
people with diabetes should carry fast-acting glucose (like juice or glucose tablets) to treat hypoglycemia.
hypoglycemia is a condition where blood sugar drops below 70 mg/dl and may cause dizziness, confusion, or fainting.
diabetes is a manageable condition with the right combination of medication, lifestyle, and monitoring.
the american diabetes association recommends annual foot exams for all patients with diabetes.
exercise helps the muscles absorb glucose without the need for insulin, which is beneficial in managing type 2 diabetes.
people with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar levels multiple times a day, especially if using insulin.
wounds and infections may take longer to heal in people with diabetes due to impaired immune response.
diabetes can increase the risk of periodontal disease, which affects the gums and teeth.
monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol is important for people with diabetes to prevent complications.
diabetes management requires a team approach involving doctors, nutritionists, and diabetes educators.
